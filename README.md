 Leaflet React Project
 
 This was screening requirement. For this company I needed to create a simple React
 project in which I would use any "map" library. I also had to render some data.
 
 Reason why it was easy is that I managed to do most stuff and every additional task 
 within a day. Only problem was that there was one task that was not properly explained but
 after sending email about and getting response, I was able to finish project properly.
 
 I did not get the job.  Which is kinda depressing...       -.-
 
 But still, I was actually quite satisfied with the way I did this task. From reading documentation,
 to using plugins (clusters) that I had to search a lot, to trying to finish a task that I did not understand
 and then properly applying solution after understanding where I was wrong. I actually was confident in my skills!
 
 Well, there is a lot to learn (TypeScript, PostCSS, React OOP), so onwards to another project.
